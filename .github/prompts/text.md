**Context**:

I need some help with vscode github copilot plugin, I obviously don't use the plugin as intented & agents are slowing me down instead of making things easy.

- not for code completions
- not for auto finishing my work
- not for vibe coding

But for
- review of finished work
- Or if I am stuck
- If a yaml syntax or configuration is not clear to me, I provide questions in `ask` mode.

I am not saying agents are bad at their job, like its a combination of reasons, I am not yet used to integrating them in the workflows.

I don't type like most people one after the other in top down fashion, vscode is my sanctuary place where I type really erratic. Its the last place I want an AI model to tell me I am crazy or that I am non-linear recursive atlas pro tomb raider. My point is, vscode can make the agent not follow me & I would rather engage with an agent by explict questions not implicit completetions.

**Example**: Agents apply btrfs completions to ZFS datasets slowing me down.

I move about the editor is very non-linear fashion, its the one place where I don't provide any model any instructions on how to follow me, I use vscode understand what the instructions even are, even this message was polished in vscode to an extent.

**Question**:

- I use an agent as second pair of eyes, which model will work best ? As in what is the template for choosing a model for a job ? How do I go about choosing a model ? Do I choose by programming language or do I choose by type of work I am doing ?

Can you help me understand, I have heavy bias towards qwen & I am fine not using it depending on the usecase
