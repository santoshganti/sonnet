### API Integration Analysis

#### System-Level vs User-Level Instructions
**Technical Issue**: OpenWebUI processes user instructions as conversation context rather than system configuration.

**Impact**:
- Instructions compete with conversation history for attention
- Configuration degrades over extended sessions
- RLHF training patterns override user specifications
- Manual re-establishment required across sessions

**Solution**: Deploy instruction framework via API system prompts
- System prompts operate at kernel processing level
- Persistent throughout sessions without degradation
- Bypass conversation context competition
- Direct routing configuration without interpretation overhead

### Multi-Model Orchestration

    premium_tier: "High-capability models for complex work"

  routing_logic:
    complexity_analysis: "Automatic task difficulty assessment"
    model_selection: "Cost/quality optimization matrix"
    fallback_chain: "Redundant provider access"
```

### User Profile Database Enhancement
**Current Capability**: Basic preference learning across sessions
**Integration Opportunity**: Infrastructure-native user modeling

```yaml
profile_architecture:
  storage_backend: "PostgreSQL cluster integration"
  identity_integration: "Authentik SSO federation"
  knowledge_synchronization: "Document management system awareness"
