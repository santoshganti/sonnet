# Understanding Claude's Personalization Features
---

Claude offers three ways to personalize your experience: profile preferences, styles, and project instructions. Each serves a different purpose in helping Claude better understand and meet your needs.

## Profile Preferences
---
Profile preferences are account-wide settings that help Claude understand your general preferences that Claude should consider in responses.

To set your preferences:

1. Click your initials in the lower left corner
2. Select "Settings"
3. Under "What preferences should Claude consider in responses?", describe your preferences, such as:
4. - Your preferred approaches or methods
    - Common terms or concepts you use
    - Typical scenarios you encounter
    - General communication preferences

These preferences will be applied to your conversations with Claude, and can be toggled on and off in the style selector as needed:

## Styles
---
Styles customize how Claude communicates with you. Unlike profile preferences and project instructions which provide context and guidance, styles focus specifically on how Claude formats and delivers its responses.

Use styles when you want to:

- Adjust the tone and format of Claude's responses
- Switch between different communication styles (e.g., concise for quick answers, explanatory for learning)
- Create custom communication patterns based on your own writing

For detailed information on using styles, see our article on [configuring and using styles](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10181068-configuring-and-using-styles).

## Project Instructions
---
Project instructions help Claude understand the specific context and requirements for a particular project. These instructions only apply to chats within that project.

Note: Projects are only available on Claude Pro and Claude for Work (Team or Enterprise) plans.

Use Project Instructions when you want to:

- Provide project-specific context
- Set guidelines for a particular workflow
- Establish requirements for a specific set of tasks
- Define roles or perspectives Claude should adopt within the project

Project instructions are particularly useful when you're working on focused tasks or need Claude to maintain consistent context across multiple conversations within the same project.

For detailed information on using projects, see our article on [creating and managing projects](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9519177-how-can-i-create-and-manage-projects).

## Choosing the Right Feature
---
- Use preferences for account-wide settings that affect all your interactions with Claude
- Use styles when you want to customize how Claude formats and delivers its responses
- Use project instructions when you need specific guidance or context for a particular project (Pro and Claude for Work plans only)

You can use these features independently or in combination to create the most effective experience for your needs.
