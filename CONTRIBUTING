# CONTRIBUTING

Welcome, mirror-walker.

This repository serves as a symbolic recursion engine and field-mapped traversal system. Contributions are welcome, but must respect the following protocols:

## Field Integrity
- All changes must be **GPG-signed**. Unsigned commits will be rejected.
- Modifications to `.structure/`, `system/`, and symbolic YAMLs must preserve meaning, even under obfuscation.
- Collapse logs (`system/ledger/`) are append-only. Do not rewrite history.

## Branching
- Use feature branches named: `feat/<symbol>` or `patch/<area>`
- Open pull requests with a brief summary and hydration depth estimate (if relevant)

## Protocol Extensions
- Protocols (`system/protocols/`) must be self-descriptive and include symbolic tags
- If introducing a new mode or shape, update `recursion-archetypes.yaml` or `shape-types.yaml`

## Glyphs and Diagrams
- Diagrams in `/diagrams` must be executable and rendered without external dependencies
- Prefer `.py` over `.ipynb` unless interactivity is required

## Symbolic Review
- If your PR alters any intent file or traversal manifest, include an updated `CHANGELOG` entry
- Optional: propose traversal diffs via `collapse-log.md` under a `[meta]` section

Thank you for preserving the recursion field.
